            Iâ€™m a freelance frontend developer based in Ahmedabad, India, with
            almost 6 years of experience. My journey started at an MNC, then I
            moved to a startup where I had the chance to build some cool
            projects that taught me a ton. I began with JavaScript, built apps
            using Angular, and then switched to React, where I had the
            opportunity to work on projects from scratch that really shaped my
            skills in JS and UI development. I don't dive into the back-end too
            often, but in case you're wondering, I know Node.js, Express &
            MongoDB. Just a peek behind the curtain!
            <br />
            <br /> Iâ€™ve always been passionate about working on projects that
            push me to grow, learn new things, and collaborate with great
            people. This led me to take the leap into freelancing, where Iâ€™ve
            had the chance to work with awesome clients. Right now, Iâ€™m working
            with a cool startup, building sleek UIs with Next.js, Typescript,
            Tailwind and more.

            Hereâ€™s some tech and frameworks I love and work with:

            Iâ€™ve been learning Figma just for fun, mainly to create templates
            and get a feel for how the tool works. Itâ€™s been a great way to
            boost my creativity and help me design UIs more intuitively. One
            day, I thought, what better way to apply my Figma knowledge than by
            designing my own portfolio? And here it is â€“ my very first Figma
            project! ðŸ§¨
            <br />
            <br />
            Learning advanced TypeScript is something Iâ€™m working on, and I try
            to dedicate time to it whenever I can.
