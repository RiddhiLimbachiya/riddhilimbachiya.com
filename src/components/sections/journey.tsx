            I&apos;m a freelance frontend developer based in Ahmedabad, India,
            with almost 6 years of experience. My journey started at an MNC,
            then I moved to a startup where I had the chance to build some cool
            projects that taught me a ton. I began with JavaScript, built apps
            using Angular, and then switched to React, where I had the
            opportunity to work on projects from scratch that really shaped my
            skills in JS and UI development. I don&apos;t dive into the back-end
            too often, but in case you&apos;re wondering, I know Node.js,
            Express & MongoDB. Just a peek behind the curtain!
            <br />
            <br /> I&apos;ve always been passionate about working on projects
            that push me to grow, learn new things, and collaborate with amazing
            people. This led me to take the leap into freelancing, where
            I&apos;ve had the chance to work with awesome clients. Right now,
            I&apos;m working with a cool startup, building sleek UIs with
            Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind and more.

                </React.Fragment>

            <span className="font-semibold text-zinc-900">Fun fact:&nbsp;</span>
            I&apos;ve been learning Figma just for fun, mainly to create
            templates and get a feel for how the tool works. It&apos;s been a
            great way to boost my creativity and help me design UIs more
            intuitively. One day, I thought, what better way to apply my Figma
            knowledge than by designing my own portfolio? And here it is - my
            very first Figma project! ðŸ§¨
            <br />
            <br />
            Learning advanced TypeScript is something I&apos;m working on, and I
            try to dedicate time to it whenever I can.
